# This script builds on 1_similarity_search.py. We will still search for git 
# commits that are semantically relevant to a user's question, but we will 
# additionally constrain our results to commits that are more recent than a 
# user-provided date. This time filtering utilizes the power of hypertables 
# -- a foundational feature of the timescaledb extension.
#
# Adding a time filter is as simple as adding a WHERE clause that constrains
# results based on the "date" column. This is easy to use but powerful. Behind 
# the scenes, the timescaledb extension "looks" at your filter criteria and is 
# able to exclude any chunks that would not match. In this way, a large amount 
# of the dataset can be ignored and no compute resources wasted on processing 
# those rows.
#
# If you need a good question to ask, try this:
# > describe how changes to decompression have improved performance
