    "# LangChain and pgvector: Up and Running\n",
    "[LangChain](https://langchain.com) is the most popular framework for building LLM applications and agents. This notebook is an introduction to building LLM applications with the LangChain framework, using PostgreSQL and pgvector as a vector database for embeddings data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the example of creating a chatbot to answer questions about the blog posts from the Timescale blog to illustrate the following concepts:\n",
    "- How to prepare your documents for insertion into PostgreSQL and pgvector using LangChain document transformer TextSplitter\n",
    "- How to create embeddings from your data using the OpenAI embeddings model and insert them into PostgreSQL and pgvector.\n",
    "- How to use embeddings retrieved from a vector database to augment LLM generation. \n",
